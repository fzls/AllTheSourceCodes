Introduction</H1></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=4>Like any human language,
Java provides a way to express concepts. If successful, this medium of
expression will be significantly easier and more flexible than the alternatives
as problems grow larger and more complex.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">You can&#8217;t look at Java as
just a collection of features; some of the features make no sense in isolation.
You can use the sum of the parts only if you are thinking about <I>design</I>,
not simply coding. And to understand Java in this way, you must understand the
problems with it and with programming in general. This book discusses
programming problems, why they are problems, and the approach Java has taken to
solve them. Thus, the set of features I explain in each chapter are based on the
way I see a particular type of problem being solved with the language. In this
way I hope to move you, a little at a time, to the point where the Java mindset
becomes your native tongue.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Throughout, I&#8217;ll be taking
the attitude that you want to build a model in your head that allows you to
develop a deep understanding of the language; if you encounter a puzzle
you&#8217;ll be able to feed it to your model and deduce the
answer.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373769"></A><A NAME="_Toc375545177"></A><A NAME="_Toc408018370"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Prerequisites</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This book assumes that you have
some programming familiarity; you understand that a program is a collection of
statements, the idea of a subroutine/function/macro, control statements such as
&#8220;if&#8221; and looping constructs such as &#8220;while,&#8221; etc.
However, you might have learned this in many places, such as programming with a
macro language or working with a tool like Perl. As long as you&#8217;ve
programmed to the point where you feel comfortable with the basic ideas of
programming, you&#8217;ll be able to work through this book. Of course, the book
will be <I>easier</I> for the C programmers and more so for the C++ programmers,
but don&#8217;t count yourself out if you&#8217;re not experienced with those
languages (but come willing to work hard). I&#8217;ll be introducing the
concepts of object-oriented programming and Java&#8217;s basic control
mechanisms, so you&#8217;ll be exposed to those, and the first exercises will
involve the basic control-flow statements.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Although references will often be
made to C and C++ language features, these are not intended to be insider
comments, but instead to help all programmers put Java in perspective with those
languages, from which, after all, Java is descended. I will attempt to make
these references simple and to explain anything that I think a non- C/C++
programmer would not be familiar
with.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373770"></A><A NAME="_Toc375545178"></A><A NAME="_Toc408018371"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Learning Java</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">At about the same time that my
first book <I>Using C++</I> (Osborne/McGraw-Hill 1989) came out, I began
teaching that language. Teaching programming languages has become my profession;
I&#8217;ve seen nodding heads, blank faces, and puzzled expressions in audiences
all over the world since 1989. As I began giving in-house training with smaller
groups of people, I discovered something during the exercises. Even those people
who were smiling and nodding were confused about many issues. I found out, by
chairing the C++ track at the <A NAME="Index1"></A><A NAME="Index2"></A>Software
Development Conference for the past few years (and now also the Java track),
that I and other speakers tended to give the typical audience too many topics
too fast. So eventually, through both variety in the audience level and the way
that I presented the material, I would end up losing some portion of the
audience. Maybe it&#8217;s asking too much, but because I am one of those people
resistant to traditional lecturing (and for most people, I believe, such
resistance results from boredom), I wanted to try to keep everyone up to
speed.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">For a time, I was creating a number
of different presentations in fairly short order. Thus, I ended up learning by
experiment and iteration (a technique that also works well in Java program
design). Eventually I developed a course using everything I had learned from my
teaching experience &#8211; one that I would be happy giving for a long time. It
tackles the learning problem in discrete, easy-to-digest steps and in a hands-on
seminar (the ideal learning situation), there are exercises following each of
the short lessons. I now give this course in
<A NAME="Index3"></A><A NAME="Index4"></A>public Java seminars, which you can
find out about at <I>http://www.BruceEckel.com</I>. (The introductory seminar is
also available as a CD ROM. Information is available at the same Web
site.)</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The feedback that I get from each
seminar helps me change and refocus the material until I think it works well as
a teaching medium. But this book isn&#8217;t just a seminar handout &#8211; I
tried to pack as much information as I could within these pages and structured
it to draw you through onto the next subject. More than anything, the book is
designed to serve the solitary reader who is struggling with a new programming
language.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373771"></A><A NAME="_Toc375545179"></A><A NAME="_Toc408018372"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Goals</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Like my previous book <I>Thinking
in C++</I>, this book has come to be structured around the process of teaching
the language. In particular, my motivation is to create something that provides
me with a way to teach the language in my own seminars. When I think of a
chapter in the book, I think in terms of what makes a good lesson during a
seminar. My goal is to get bite-sized pieces that can be taught in a reasonable
amount of time, followed by exercises that are feasible to accomplish in a
classroom situation.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">My goals in this book are
to:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<OL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=5>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Present
the material one simple step at a time so that you can easily digest each
concept before moving
on.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=5>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Use
examples that are as simple and short as possible. This sometimes prevents me
from tackling &#8220;real world&#8221; problems, but I&#8217;ve found that
beginners are usually happier when they can understand every detail of an
example rather than being impressed by the scope of the problem it solves. Also,
there&#8217;s a severe limit to the amount of code that can be absorbed in a
classroom situation. For this I will no doubt receive criticism for using
&#8220;toy examples,&#8221; but I&#8217;m willing to accept that in favor of
producing something pedagogically
useful.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=5>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Carefully
sequence the presentation of features so that you aren&#8217;t seeing something
that you haven&#8217;t been exposed to. Of course, this isn&#8217;t always
possible; in those situations, a brief introductory description is
given.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=5>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Give
you what I think is important for you to understand about the language, rather
than everything I know. I believe there is an information importance hierarchy,
and that there are some facts that 95 percent of programmers will never need to
know and just confuses people and adds to their perception of the complexity of
the language. To take an example from C, if you memorize the operator precedence
table (I never did), you can write clever code. But if you need to think about
it, it will also confuse the reader/maintainer of that code. So forget about
precedence, and use parentheses when things aren&#8217;t clear.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=5>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Keep
each section focused enough so that the lecture time &#8211; and the time
between exercise periods &#8211; is small. Not only does this keep the
audience&#8217;s minds more active and involved during a hands-on seminar, but
it gives the reader a greater sense of
accomplishment.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=5>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Provide
you with a solid foundation so that you can understand the issues well enough to
move on to more difficult coursework and
books.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373772"></A><A NAME="_Toc375545180"></A><A NAME="_Toc408018373"></A></OL><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Online documentation</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The Java language and libraries
from Sun Microsystems (a free download) come with documentation in electronic
form, readable using a Web browser, and virtually every third party
implementation of Java has this or an equivalent documentation system. Almost
all the books published on Java have duplicated this documentation. So you
either already have it or you can download it, and unless necessary, this book
will not repeat that documentation because it&#8217;s usually much faster if you
find the class descriptions with your Web browser than if you look them up in a
book. (Plus it will be up-to-date.) This book will provide extra descriptions of
the classes only when it&#8217;s necessary to supplement the documentation so
you can understand a particular
example.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc408018374"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading7"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Chapters</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This book was designed with one
thing in mind: the way people learn the Java language. Seminar audience feedback
helped me understand which parts were difficult and needed illumination. In the
areas where I got ambitious and included too many features all at once, I came
to know &#8211; through the process of presenting the material &#8211; that if
you include a lot of new features, you need to explain them all, and this easily
compounds the student&#8217;s confusion. As a result, I&#8217;ve taken a great
deal of trouble to introduce the features as few at a time as
possible.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The goal, then, is for each chapter
to teach a single feature, or a small group of associated features, in such a
way that no additional features are relied upon. That way you can digest each
piece in the context of your current knowledge before moving
on.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Here is a brief description of the
chapters contained in the book, which correspond to lectures and exercise
periods in my hands-on seminars.</FONT><A NAME="OLE_LINK10"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 1:	<B><I>Introduction to
objects</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter is an overview of what
object-oriented programming is all about, including the answer to the basic
question &#8220;What&#8217;s an object?&#8221;, interface vs. implementation,
abstraction and encapsulation, messages and functions, inheritance and
composition, and the all-important polymorphism. You&#8217;ll also be introduced
to issues of object creation such as constructors, where the objects live, where
to put them once they&#8217;re created, and the magical garbage collector that
cleans up the objects that are no longer needed. Other issues will be
introduced, including error handling with exceptions, multithreading for
responsive user interfaces, and networking and the Internet. You&#8217;ll also
learn about what makes Java special, why it&#8217;s been so successful, and
about object-oriented analysis and design. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 2:<B><I>	Everything is an
object</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter moves you to the point
where you can write your first Java program, so it must give an overview of the
essentials, including the concept of a &#8220;handle&#8221; to an object; how to
create an object; an introduction to primitive types and arrays; scoping and the
way objects are destroyed by the garbage collector; how everything in Java is a
new data type (class) and how to create your own classes; functions, arguments,
and return values; name visibility and using components from other libraries;
the <B>static</B> keyword; comments and embedded documentation.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 3:<B><I> 	Controlling
program flow</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter begins with all of the
operators that come to Java from C and C++. In addition, you&#8217;ll discover
common operator pitfalls, casting, promotion, and precedence. This is followed
by the basic control-flow and selection operations that you get with virtually
any programming language: choice with if-else; looping with for and while;
quitting a loop with break and continue as well as Java&#8217;s labeled break
and labeled continue (which account for the &#8220;missing goto&#8221; in Java);
and selection using switch. Although much of this material has common threads
with C and C++ code, there are some differences. In addition, all the examples
will be full Java examples so you&#8217;ll get more comfortable with what Java
looks like. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 4:<B><I> 	Initialization
and cleanup</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter begins by introducing
the constructor, which guarantees proper initialization. The definition of the
constructor leads into the concept of function overloading (since you might want
several constructors). This is followed by a discussion of the process of
cleanup, which is not always as simple as it seems. Normally, you just drop an
object when you&#8217;re done with it and the garbage collector eventually comes
along and releases the memory. This portion explores the garbage collector and
some of its idiosyncrasies. The chapter concludes with a closer look at how
things are initialized: automatic member initialization, specifying member
initialization, the order of initialization, <B>static</B> initialization and
array initialization. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 5:<B><I> 	Hiding the
implementation</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter covers the way that
code is packaged together, and why some parts of a library are exposed while
other parts are hidden. It begins by looking at the <B>package</B> and
<B>import</B> keywords, which perform file-level packaging and allow you to
build libraries of classes. The subject of directory paths and file names is
also examined. The remainder of the chapter looks at the <B>public</B>,
<B>private,</B> and <B>protected</B> keywords, the concept of
&#8220;friendly&#8221; access, and what the different levels of access control
mean when used in various contexts. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 6:<B><I> 	Reusing classes
</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The concept of inheritance is
standard in virtually all OOP languages. It&#8217;s a way to take an existing
class and add to its functionality (as well as change it, the subject of Chapter
7). Inheritance is often a way to reuse code by leaving the &#8220;base
class&#8221; the same, and just patching things here and there to produce what
you want. However, inheritance isn&#8217;t the only way to make new classes from
existing ones. You can also embed an object inside your new class with
<I>composition</I>. In this chapter you&#8217;ll learn about these two ways to
reuse code in Java, and how to apply them. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 7:<B><I>
	Polymorphism</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">On your own, you might take nine
months to discover and understand polymorphism, a cornerstone of OOP. Through
small, simple examples you&#8217;ll see how to create a family of types with
inheritance and manipulate objects in that family through their common base
class. Java&#8217;s polymorphism allows you to treat all objects in this family
generically, which means the bulk of your code doesn&#8217;t rely on specific
type information. This makes your programs extensible, so building programs and
code maintenance is easier and cheaper. In addition, Java provides a third way
to set up a reuse relationship through the <I>interface</I>, which is a pure
abstraction of the interface of an object. Once you&#8217;ve seen polymorphism,
the interface can be clearly understood. This chapter also introduces Java 1.1
<I>inner classes</I>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 8:<B><I> 	Holding your
objects </I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">It&#8217;s a fairly simple program
that has only a fixed quantity of objects with known lifetimes. In general, your
programs will always be creating new objects at a variety of times that will be
known only while the program is running. In addition, you won&#8217;t know until
run-time the quantity or even the exact type of the objects you need. To solve
the general programming problem, you need to create any number of objects,
anytime, anywhere. This chapter explores in depth the tools that Java supplies
to hold objects while you&#8217;re working with them: the simple arrays and more
sophisticated collections (data structures) such as <B>Vector</B> and
<B>Hashtable</B>. Finally, the new and improved Java 1.2 collections library is
explored in depth.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 9:<B><I> 	Error handling
with exceptions</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The basic philosophy of Java is
that badly-formed code will not be run. As much as possible, the compiler
catches problems, but sometimes the problems &#8211; either programmer error or
a natural error condition that occurs as part of the normal execution of the
program &#8211; can be detected and dealt with only at run-time. Java has
<I>exception handling</I> to deal with any problems that arise while the program
is running. This chapter examines how the keywords <B>try</B>, <B>catch</B>,
<B>throw</B>, <B>throws</B>, and <B>finally</B> work in Java; when you should
throw exceptions and what to do when you catch them. In addition, you&#8217;ll
see Java&#8217;s standard exceptions, how to create your own, what happens with
exceptions in constructors, and how exception handlers are located.
</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 10:<B><I> 	The Java IO
system </I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Theoretically, you can divide any
program into three parts: input, process, and output. This implies that IO
(input/output) is a pretty important part of the equation. In this chapter
you&#8217;ll learn about the different classes that Java provides for reading
and writing files, blocks of memory, and the console. The distinction between
&#8220;old&#8221; IO and &#8220;new&#8221; Java 1.1<A NAME="Index5"></A> IO will
be shown. In addition, this section examines the process of taking an object,
&#8220;streaming&#8221; it (so that it can be placed on disk or sent across a
network) and reconstructing it, which is handled for you in Java version 1.1.
Also, Java 1.1&#8217;s compression libraries, which are used in the Java ARchive
file format (JAR), are examined.</FONT><A NAME="OLE_LINK9"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 11:<B><I> 	Run-time type
identification</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Java run-time type identification
(RTTI) lets you find the exact type of an object when you have a handle to only
the base type. Normally, you&#8217;ll want to intentionally ignore the exact
type of an object and let Java&#8217;s dynamic binding mechanism (polymorphism)
implement the correct behavior for that type. But occasionally it is very
helpful to know the exact type of an object for which you have only a base
handle. Often this information allows you to perform a special-case operation
more efficiently. This chapter explains what RTTI is for, how to use it and how
to get rid of it when it doesn&#8217;t belong there. In addition, the Java 1.1
<I>reflection</I> feature is introduced.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 12:<B><I>	Passing and
returning objects</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Since the only way you talk to
objects in Java is through &#8220;handles,&#8221; the concepts of passing an
object into a function and returning an object from a function have some
interesting consequences. This chapter explains what you need to know to manage
objects when you&#8217;re moving in and out of functions, and also shows the
<B>String</B> class, which uses a different approach to the
problem.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 13:<B><I>	Creating windows
and applets</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Java comes with the <I>Abstract</I>
<I>Window Toolkit</I> (AWT), which is a set of classes that handle windowing in
a portable fashion; these windowing programs can either be applets or
stand-alone applications. This chapter is an introduction to the AWT and the
creation of World Wide Web applets. We&#8217;ll also look at pros and cons of
the AWT and the GUI improvements introduced in Java 1.1. The important
&#8220;Java Beans&#8221; technology is introduced. This is fundamental for the
creation of Rapid-Application Development (RAD) program-building tools. Finally,
the new Java 1.2 &#8220;Swing&#8221; library is introduced &#8211; this provides
a dramatic improvement in UI components for Java.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 14<B><I>: 	Multiple threads
</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Java provides a built-in facility
to support multiple concurrent subtasks, called <I>threads</I>, running within a
single program. (Unless you have multiple processors on your machine, this is
only the <I>appearance</I> of multiple subtasks.) Although these can be used
anywhere, threads are most powerful when trying to create a responsive user
interface so, for example, a user isn&#8217;t prevented from pressing a button
or entering data while some processing is going on. This chapter looks at the
syntax and semantics of multithreading in Java. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 15: 	<B><I>Network
programming </I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">All the Java features and libraries
seem to really come together when you start writing programs to work across
networks. This chapter explores communication across the Internet, and the
classes that Java provides to make this easier. It also shows you how to create
a Java applet that talks to a <I>common gateway interface </I>(CGI) program,
shows you how to write CGI programs in C++ and covers Java 1.1&#8217;s <I>Java
DataBase Connectivity</I> (JDBC) and <I>Remote Method Invocation</I>
(RMI).</FONT><A NAME="OLE_LINK13"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 16: 	<B><I>Design
patterns<A NAME="OLE_LINK12"></A></I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter introduces the very
important and yet non-traditional &#8220;patterns&#8221; approach to program
design. An example of the design evolution process is studied, starting with an
initial solution and moving through the logic and process of evolving the
solution to more appropriate designs. You&#8217;ll see one way that a design can
materialize over time.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Chapter 17: 	<B><I>Projects
</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter includes a set of
projects that build on the material presented in this book, or otherwise
didn&#8217;t fit in earlier chapters. These projects are significantly more
complex than the examples in the rest of the book, and they often demonstrate
new techniques and uses of class libraries.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">There are subjects that
didn&#8217;t seem to fit within the core of the book, and yet I find that I
discuss them during seminars. These are placed in the
appendices.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Appendix A: 	<B><I>Using non-Java
code</I></B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A totally portable Java program has
serious drawbacks: speed and the inability to access platform-specific services.
When you know the platform that you&#8217;re running on, it&#8217;s possible to
dramatically speed up certain operations by making them <I>native methods</I>,
which are functions that are written in another programming language (currently,

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">If you&#8217;re a C++ programmer,
you already have the basic idea of object-oriented programming, and the syntax
of Java no doubt looks very familiar to you. This makes sense because Java was
derived from C++. However, there are a surprising number of differences between
C++ and Java. These differences are intended to be significant improvements, and
if you understand the differences you&#8217;ll see why Java is such a beneficial
programming language. This appendix takes you through the important features
that make Java distinct from C++.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">I use a particular coding style for

original <I>The C++ Programming Language</I> (Addison-Wesley, 1991;

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Although I test the code in this
book with several different vendor implementations of Java, I generally rely on
the Sun implementation as a reference when determining whether behavior is
correct.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">By the time you read this, Sun will
have released three major versions of Java: 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 (Sun says it will
make a major release about every nine months!). Version 1.1 represents a
significant change to the language and should probably have been labeled 2.0.
(And if 1.1 is such a big change from 1.0, I shudder to think what will justify
the number 2.0.) However, it&#8217;s version 1.2 that seems to finally bring
Java into the prime time, in particular where user interface tools are
concerned.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This book covers versions 1.0, 1.1
and selected parts of 1.2, although in situations where a new approach is
clearly superior to the old, I definitely favor the new approach, often choosing
to teach the better approach and completely ignore the old approach. However,
there are some cases where it&#8217;s unavoidable to teach the old approach
before the new, in particular with the AWT, since not only is there a lot of old
Java 1.0 code out there, but some platforms still support only Java 1.0. I will
try to be scrupulous about pointing out which features belong to which
version.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">One thing you&#8217;ll notice is
that I don&#8217;t use the sub-revision numbers. At this writing, the released
version of 1.0 from Sun was 1.02 and the released version of 1.1 was 1.1.5 (Java
1.2 was in beta). In this book I will refer to <A NAME="Index19"></A>Java 1.0,
Java 1.1<A NAME="Index20"></A> and Java 1.2 only<A NAME="Index21"></A>, to guard

Note on the cover design</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The cover of <I>Thinking in
Java</I> is inspired by the American Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, which began
near the turn of the century and reached its zenith between 1900 and 1920. It
began in England as a reaction to both the machine production of the Industrial
Revolution and the highly ornamental style of the Victorian era. Arts &amp;
Crafts emphasized spare design, the forms of nature as seen in the art nouveau
movement, hand-crafting, and the importance of the individual craftsperson, and
yet it did not eschew the use of modern tools. There are many echoes with the
situation we have today: the impending turn of the century, the evolution from
the raw beginnings of the computer revolution to something more refined and
meaningful to individual persons, and the emphasis on software craftsmanship
rather than just manufacturing code. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">I see Java in this same way: as an
attempt to elevate the programmer away from an operating-system mechanic and
towards being a &#8220;software craftsman.&#8221;</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Both the author and the book/cover
designer (who have been friends since childhood) find inspiration in this
movement, and both own furniture, lamps and other pieces that are either
original or inspired by this period. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The other theme in this cover
suggests a collection box that a naturalist might use to display the insect
specimens that he or she has preserved. These insects are objects, placed within
the box objects which are themselves placed within the &#8220;cover
object,&#8221; which illustrates the fundamental concept of aggregation in
object-oriented programming. Of course, a programmer cannot help but make the
association with &#8220;bugs,&#8221; and here the bugs have been captured and
presumably killed in a specimen jar, and finally confined within a small display
box, as if to imply Java&#8217;s ability to find, display and subdue bugs (which
is truly one of its most powerful
attributes).</FONT><A NAME="_Toc408018383"></A><BR></P></DIV>
